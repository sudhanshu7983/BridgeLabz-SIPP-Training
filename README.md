☕ BridgeLabz
Welcome to the official repository of BridgeLabz – a learning and development space focused on building strong programming fundamentals across various technical domains.

🚀 BridgeLabz SIPP Training
This repository contains Java projects and problem statements developed during the BridgeLabz Summer Internship Program (SIPP). It is organized into multiple branches, each focusing on a specific area such as Core Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and hands-on Workshops.

📁 Repository Structure
This repository consists of the following main branches/modules:

main
core-java
Each branch contains a series of tasks organized by day, ensuring consistent and structured learning.
